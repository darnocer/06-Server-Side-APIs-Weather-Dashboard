## Description

This application utilizes the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities entered by the user and dynamically updates the weather for the selected city. `localStorage` is used to store user-entered cities as persistent data.

## Usage

- Search for a city in the search bar to see the current weather (conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index) and the 5 day forecast
- Enter multiple cities to build up a list of "favorites". Refresh the page or come back later and the cities will persist, and dynamically update with the current conditions and forecast.
- Switch between cities by selecting from the list
- Clear all cities from localStorage at any time using the "Clear All" button
- UV Index background color updates in accordance with accepted danger levels associated with each value
